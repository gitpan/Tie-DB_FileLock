DESCRIPTION
-----------

	Module DB_File allows perl to tie hashes to on-disk dbm
	files, but fails to provide any method by which the hashes
	might be locked, providing exclusive access or preventing
	page-level collisions.  Tie::DB_FileLock extends DB_File,
	providing a locking layer using flock().

	Unlike Tie::DB_Lock, Tie::DB_FileLock does not duplicate
	files to allow concurrent access for readers and writers.
	Tie::DB_FileLock is therefore suitable for large dbms with
	relatively short locking periods.

	DB_File::Lock is another option, a lightweight wrapper
	around DB_File using an external lockfile.
	See the POD documentation for more information.

FEEDBACK
--------

How to report a problem with Tie::DB_FileLock.

To help me help you, I need of the following information:

 1. The version of Perl and the operating system name and version you
    are running.  The command 'perl -V' should provide everything.

 2. The version of Tie::DB_FileLock you have installed.  If you've installed
    Tie::DB_FileLock, this one-liner will tell you:

	perl -e 'use Tie::DB_FileLock; print "V: $Tie::DB_FileLock::VERSION\n"'

    Otherwise search DB_FileLock.pm for a line like this:

	$VERSION = 'X.XX';

 3. The error message(s) generated or a concise description of the problem.

 4. Finally if this is a bug, a fix or a small example of the bug.
