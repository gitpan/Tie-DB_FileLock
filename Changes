0.09	Mon Jun 28 15:07:34 PDT 1999	John M Vinopal

Renamed to Tie::DB_FileLock from DB_File for inclusion in CPAN.
Rolled in the DB_File 1.65 tests.  Created Makefile.PL.  Finally
wrote a README file.  Wrote -this- file.

0.10	Mon Jan 10 23:58:34 PST 2000	John M Vinopal

Rolled in the DB_File 1.71 tests.  Fixed filter stubs.  Revised
FIRSTKEY() and NEXTKEY() to call the same in DB_File, and rid myself
of the evilness that was doubling keys() execution time.  Now calling
the lower-level put() and get() functions to avoid filter side-effects.
Ran some simple benchmarks and added a 'Speed' section to the docs.

0.11	Fri May 14 14:57:01 PDT 2010	John M Vinopal
